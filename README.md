Project 1 for BME 5990, created a few models. 
I made three seperate CNN's, with different architectures and results. 
The first CNN has 5 convulutional layers with varying sizes of filters that steadily increase, and two fully connected layers, as well as batch normalization. 
The second CNN has 3 convulutional layers and 2 fully connected layers with all filter sizes 128. 
The third CNN has 5 convolutional layers, 2 fully connected, and all filter sizes 256. 

The best model (assessed via scatter plot evaluation) was the third one, but the second was very close behind. Both had R2 values of around 0.65. The first one had an R2 of .45.
